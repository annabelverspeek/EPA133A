# EPA1352 Lab Assignment Submission Guidelines

Last updated: 2024-01-15

## Folder Structure

Please follow the format below (not every folder is necessary for every assignment!). You can use the template folder provided. 

```
├── README.md          <- The top-level README explaining what the
│                         project is (preferably in Markdown formatting).
├── data
│   ├── interim        
│   ├── processed     
│   └── raw           
│
├── model             <- Model files, e.g. `G02-A2-Model.py`
│   ├── input         <- Model input files
│   └── output        <- Model output files
│
├── notebook          <- Jupyter notebook files. Naming convention: your group number,
│                         and a short `-` delimited description,
│                         e.g. `G04-A1-initial-data-exploration`.
├── report            <- Your report e.g. `EPA133a-G04-A2-Report.pdf`
│   └── figures       
│
├── requirements.txt  <- The requirements file for reproducing the
│                        analysis environment, e.g. generated with 
│                        `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if using Python
```

## File Naming

Name the overall zipped file, compiled reports, and main model so that we can easily identify you. Please follow this format:

>EPA133a-G\<2-Digit Group Number>-A\<Assignment Number>-\<Optional Title>

For example, group 4 submitting assignment 2 should be `EPA133a-G04-A2.zip`.

Please use two digits behind the group number to help us sort and organize submissions more easily.
